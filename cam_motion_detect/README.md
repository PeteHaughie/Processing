# Cam Motion Detect

This shader and sketch was based on Posy's Motion Extraction idea https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSS6yAMZF78

Processing is too slow to do this on its own but using it as a canvas for shaders is very handy.

All you have to do is run it and hit the s key if you want to save the output.

Tested on Mac OS 14.2.1 which is stuck on an old OpenGL release so if you're on an operating system more reasonable then you shouldn't have any problems.
